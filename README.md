### Our Own Goals
<br>
<p>This app is designed as a teaching tool in the form of a penalty shoot out based game to be used either in small group settings and/or over Zoom to revise material taught in the lesson/session.
</p>

<p>
It revolves around a competitive quiz element where a correct answer lets the player take a penalty.
</p>


### Our MVP:

* The user must be able to answer questions coming from a self-made API.
* The players must be able to control the striker and goalkeeper in the penalty.
* The score should be displayed throughout the game.
* The app must have a start screen with at least a name selector.


### Resources used:

* React
* Spring
* Bootstrap
* Hibernate
* Framer

From the command line:
Complete an npm install and open the server package with your favoured IDE, run the application to load the database of questions/answers. 
CD to client package, npm install and npm start to enable and open the frontend.
Navigate to the React URL, typically http://127.0.0.1:3000.
