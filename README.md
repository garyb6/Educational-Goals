It revolves around a competitive quiz element where a correct answer lets the player take a penalty. 

The user must be able to answer questions coming from a self-made API.
The players must be able to control the striker and goalkeeper in the penalty.
The score should be displayed throughout the game.
The app must have a start screen with at least a name selector.
