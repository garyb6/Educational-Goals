Educational Goals is a competitive quiz game which will help you study a variety of topics!

To begin the game, input your name, select your goalkeeperâ€™s colour and the quiz you want to play.

Each player takes turns answering questions and taking penalties. If you get the question correct you get a chance to score a goal while your opponent controls the keeper. The controls are:
 
Player One		Player 2
A - Left				J - Left
S - Middle		K - Middle
D - Right			L - Right

Whoever scores the most penalties wins!

You can also create your own quizzes to play with your friends!
